### Problem Identification

The organisation using manual system to manage salaries have to calculate salaries and tax deduction af the employee.  The manual work required a lot of papperwork and handle several type of files manually. They have to keep record of tax of whole organization. All this paperwork is extremly time consuming job, and accordingly costly as well as they have to hire more man power to the job in time.

There is always a risk of human error in the manual work, which will eventually halt or slow down the productivity of whole organisation. And if there is a delay in payment of salaries of any employee then this affect the relationship of organisation and the employee. Therefore organisation require a software that can handle all of the work without making any error and reduce the time and cost of managing the salry.
