## Introduction

  

  

The aim of this project is to automate the salary system of an organisation. The Salary Management System helps streamline and centralize the salary payments of the organisation. It helps an organisation to manage the salary of the employees. The software calculate salary, incentives, bonus and tax deduction etc by itself.

### Problem Identification

  

  

The organisation using manual system to manage salaries have to calculate salaries and tax deduction af the employee. The manual work required a lot of paper work and handle several type of files manually. They have to keep record of tax of whole organization. All this paperwork is extremly time consuming job, and accordingly costly as well as they have to hire more man power to the job in time.

  

  

There is always a risk of human error in the manual work, which will eventually halt or slow down the productivity of whole organisation. And if there is a delay in payment of salaries of any employee then this affect the relationship of organisation and the employee. Therefore organisation require a software that can handle all of the work without making any error and reduce the time and cost of managing the salry.

### State of Art

  

* Before salary management system, the organization have to do all the work of managing manually. This was a tidious task to do and lot of paper work to handle. First generation of salary managemnt system does not have any databases. They were just being used to cut down the time nedded in calculation. User still have to manually feed the required input to the system in order to get results. Salaray managemnt system were added as a module to the accounting system of the organisation, which have only few features. Support for the database was included in later years with dedicated software which truly streamlined the processes.
